I love to do Machine Learning Modeling and Deep learning Modeling. I'm good in Python too. I create blog posts and open source packages mainly about python and data engineering, data Science and data Analyses.  I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others a public as possible.  You can see a full list of what I am up to on [github.com](https://github.com/Mohammad-Dawoood/Mohammad-Dawoood).

### My favourite work

I am a Data Science Enthusiastic. I love to do work on Python. I am always ready to do Modeling on the Data. My favourite Machine Learning model is Random Forest because it is useful in both Classification and Regression Problem. Apart from that, I Write blogs about my learnings and the experience I got from it. You can take a look at my work on the files I upload on Github and read the blogs I write after completing a task. Hope you like it. Thank you.
